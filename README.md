# Techno-economic cell selection for battery-electric long-haul trucks

To reach cost-parity with diesel trucks, battery-electric trucks require fast-chargeable lithium-ion cells with a high energy density and cycle life, at a low specific cost. However, cells generally excel at only a fraction of these characteristics. To help select the optimal cell, we have developed the techno-economic cell selection method. 

This repository provides the source code to the method, which we use to select the optimal cell out of a database containing over 160 cells for a long-haul truck operating with a single driver in Germany. The detailed documentation can be found in the following publication: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.103832](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etran.2022.100225)

## Prerequisites
To run the code, you'll need the following python packages: 
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - numba
  - matplotlib

## Running the Model/Code

The results and all figures are generated by executing the file main.py. The execution time on a 16GB RAM, 1.8GHz machine is less than 30 seconds.
